* Motivation
** The Experiment:
  + "Cooperation in a fluid swarm of fuel-free micro-swimmers" by MYB Zion, A Modin, Y Caba, PM Chaikin (2021). [[https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.15087][arXiv: 2012.15087]]
** Key Features
  + Constructed particles that are active but 'fuel-free'. Dynamics of Particles unaffected by local fuel concentrations.
  + Study focused on behaviour exhibited by aggregates
    - Homogeneous system of Active Particles
    - Heterogenous system: Mixture of Active and Passive
  + Homogeneous System: Motility Induced Phase Separation (MIPS)
  + Heterogeneous System: A new phase - 'Corralling'; Passive Particles compressed to HCP by active particles

* The Experiment: Key Details
** Particles:
  + Passive: Spherical liquid droplets of n-dodecane in oil-water emulsion
  + Active: Light Absorbing Particle coupled to passive sphere; 'Peanut' Shaped
  + Medium: Water; Particles exhibit Brownian Motion 
** Activity
  + Energy for active particles derived from light
  + Temperature gradient formed by light absorbing particles heating water surrounding it when exposed to light; Gradient verly localized to the particle
  + Propulsion along the axis due to thermo-capillary effect
  + Continuous relation between flux and activity
  
* Relevant Study: Active Dumbbells
 + "Dynamics of a homogeneous active dumbbell system" by A Suma, G Gonnella, G Laghezza, A Lamura, A Mossaâ€¦ - Physical Review E, 2014. [[https://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.90.052130][Phys. Rev. E 90, 052130]]
 + A Theoretical + Computational study about the system of active dumbbells
 + Behaviour observed similar to previous experiment's study on Homogeneous System
 
* Simulating the System
 + Need to write own code from scratch to implement the driving forces
 + Reason: Lack of support to assign forces dynamically to each particle in LAMMPS
 + Objective of the Project: To simulate the heterogeneous system and observe/study the 'coralling' phase
 
* The Model: Potentials
 + Weeks-Chandler-Anderson(WCA) Potential
\begin{equation}
V_{WCA}(r) = \begin{cases}
V_{LJ}(r) - V_{LJ}(r_c) & r < r_c\\
0 & r > r_c
\end{cases}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
V_{LJ} = 4\epsilon\bqty{\pqty{\frac{\sigma}{r}}^{12} - \pqty{\frac{\sigma}{r}}^{6}} \ \ ;\ \ r_c = 2^{1/6}\sigma
\end{equation}
where $\sigma$ is the diameter of the spherical particles

 + Spring: Finite Extensible Nonlinear Elastic (FENE)
\begin{equation}
F_{FENE}(\mathbf{r}) = \frac{- k \mathbf{r}}{1 - \pqty{r / r_0}^2}
\end{equation}
where $r_0$ represents the maximum spring length

* The Model: Particles
 + Passive: Spherical

 + Activity: Force with fixed magnitude acting on the two spheres of the dumbbell directed along the axis

* Equations of Motion: Langevin Dynamics
 + As particles are in a medium, either the particles in it or their effect on other particles need to be simulated
 + Langevin Dynamics allows us to simulate two key effects of the medium:
   - Resistance to Movement i.e Viscosity; $\propto \vb{v}(t)$
   - Random force due to fluctuations in the medium's density: $\xi(t)$
 + Equations of Motion:
\begin{align*}
\dd{x_i}(t) &= v_i(t)\dd{t} \\
\dd{v_i}(t) &= m_i^{-1} F_i(x(t)) - \gamma_i v_i(t) \dd{t} + \sqrt{2 k_B T \gamma_i m_i^{-1}} \dd{W_i}(t)
\end{align*}

* Langevin Equations (Continued)
 + $W(t)$ - Wiener Process
    - $W(0) = 0$
    - Increments are independent: $W(t+u) - W(t)$ is independent for all past values $W(s)$ for all $u, t > 0, s \leq t$;
    - Increments are from normal distribution: $W(t+u) - W(t) \sim \mathcal{N}(0, u)$
    - $W$ is continuous in $t$
  + Coefficient of last term derived from this condition
    - $\expval{v^2(t)}_{eq} = \frac{k_BT}{M}$

 + Integration Scheme provided by: "Second-order integrators for Langevin equations with holonomic constraints" by E Vanden-Eijnden, G Ciccotti - Chemical physics letters, 2006. [[https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cplett.2006.07.086][https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0009261406011092]]
 + Modified Velocity Verlet Scheme

* Integrating Equations of Motion
 + Changing Notation: $f_i(x) = m_i^{-1}F_i(x)$, $\sigma = \sqrt{2 k_B T \gamma_i m_i^{-1}}$
\begin{align*}
\dd{x_i}(t) &= v_i(t)\dd{t}\\
\dd{v_i}(t) &= f_i(x(t)) - \gamma_i v_i(t) \dd{t} + \sigma_i \dd{W_i}(t)
\end{align*}
\begin{align}
v^{n+1/2} ={}&v^n + \frac{1}{2} h f(x^n) - \frac{1}{2} h \gamma v^n + \frac{1}{2} \sqrt{h} \sigma \xi^n \notag\\
&-\frac{1}{8} h^2 \gamma \pqty{f(x^n) - \gamma v^n} - \frac{1}{4} h^{3/2} \gamma \sigma \pqty{\frac{1}{2} \xi^n + \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} \eta^n} \\
x^{n+1} ={}&x^n + h v^{n+1/2} + \frac{1}{2\sqrt{3}}h^{3/2} \sigma \eta^n \\
v^{n+1} ={}&v^{n+1/2} + \frac{1}{2} h f(x^{n+1}) - \frac{1}{2} h \gamma v^{n+1/2} + \frac{1}{2} \sqrt{h} \sigma \xi^n \notag\\
&-\frac{1}{8} h^2 \gamma \pqty{f(x^{n+1}) - \gamma v^{n+1/2}} - \frac{1}{4} h^{3/2} \gamma \sigma \pqty{\frac{1}{2} \xi^n + \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} \eta^n}
\end{align}

  + Note that setting $\gamma = \sigma = 0$ results in Velocity Verlet

* Testing Accuracy: Simulating LJ Fluid
  + Benchmark outlined by: "The Lennard-Jones equation of state revisited" by  JK Johnson, JA Zollweg, KE Gubbins - Molecular Physics, 1993. [[https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00268979300100411][https://doi.org/10.1080/00268979300100411]]
  + Involves simulating $N=864$ particles with $r_c = 4.0\sigma$ as the cutoff radius of LJ potential
  + Test Condition: Pass when potential energy within range given in paper
  + Benchmarked for only a few paramters: $T^*=6$ with $\rho^*$ ranging from 0.1 to 1.25
  + Future Plan: Benchmark using: "Efficient Computation of Entropy and Other Thermodynamic Properties for Two-Dimensional Systems Using Two-Phase Thermodynamic Model" by  SS Pannir Sivajothi, ST Lin, PK Maiti - The Journal of Physical Chemistry B, 2018. [[https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jpcb.8b07147][DOI: 10.1021/acs.jpcb.8b07147]]
  
* 3D LJ Fluid Simulation

 
* Testing Accuracy: Langevin Dynamics
  + Simple test using relation between mean square displacement (MSD) vs Time for different parameters.
\begin{align*}
\expval{r^2(t)} = &v^2(0)\tau^2\pqty{1-e^{-t/\tau}}^2 + \frac{6k_BT}{m}\tau t\\
&- \frac{3k_BT}{m}\tau^2\pqty{1-e^{-t/\tau}}\pqty{3 - e^{-t/\tau}}
\end{align*}
where $\tau = \gamma^{-1}$ is the relaxation time of the Brownian Motion
 + Note that the above applies to 3D system where $Nk_BT = 3K_BT$
 + For small time scales: $\expval{r^2(t\ll\tau)} = v^2(0)t^2$
 + For large time scales: $\expval{r^2(t\gg\tau)} = 6k_BT\tau t/m$

* Simulating Active Matter: Issues
 + To observe Phase Separation and internal flow, the number of particles required to simulate is very large, resulting in long calculation time and heavy memory requirements.
 + The code is single threaded.
   - Multithreading via OpenMP is simple for NumPy (BLAS Operations), but needs to be explicit for Cython
 + Need to implement efficient algorithm for calculating LJ Interaction.
